Welcome to Pandas\n","[Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)  is a Python tool that helps you work with and analyze data organized in columns, kind of like a spreadsheet. It’s widely used in data science and is supported by many machine learning tools. While pandas has a lot of features, its basic ideas are easy to learn, and we’ll cover them here. For a more complete reference, the [pandas docs site](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html) contains extensive documentation and many tutorials."],"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"TIFJ83ZTBctl"}},{"source":["\n","\n","**Reminder:** every time we see a cell block we should run that cell to see what it outputs.
