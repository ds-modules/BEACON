    "## Exploring Emissions and the Atmosphere\n",
    "\n",
    "**Emissions** are gases and particles that are released into the air. They can come from a variety of sources, including cars, factories, power plants, and even natural sources like volcanoes.\n",
    "    When we talk about emissions, we're often talking about greenhouse gas emissions. These are gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide that trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere and contribute to global warming and climate change.Given the current concerns regarding Global warming and we need to acknowledge that every year around 10 Gigatons of carbon (thatâ€™s 10 x 109 tons of carbon per year, written as GtC/yr) is emitted by combustion of fossil fuels, which has devastating enviornmental effects. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **Atmospere** is a layer of gas that surrounds the Earth. It's made up of different gases, including nitrogen, oxygen, and a small amount of other gases like carbon dioxide and methane.\n",
    "Understanding it's impact is super important because it protects us from harmful radiation from the sun and helps regulate the temperature of the Earth. It's kind of like a blanket that keeps the Earth warm and cozy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Analytics** plays a important role in answering questions like, where does all this carbon come from? Where does it all go? How does it get there?"

    "#### Introduction to the BEACON Dataset:\n",
    "BEACO2N (Berkeley Environmental Air-quality & CO2 Network) is a new strategy for understanding green house gases (GHGs) and air quality at street level in near real time, giving pedestrians, companies, and policy-makers unique insight into their GHG emissions and air quality experiences. \n",
    "    Through their technology, BEACO2N is able to create a **highly detailed map** of CO2 and pollutants in our air. The data provides a clear route to evaluating the effectiveness of local and regional efforts to reduce GHG emissions, improve air quality, improve environmental equity and reduce the detrimental effects of emissions on public health.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check out the website here for some cool visulizations and data: http://beacon.berkeley.edu/metadata/\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"b.png\" align=\"center\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Who collected the data?\n",
    "BEACO2N data is collected by a network of sensors, also known as \"nodes\", that are deployed in various locations. The nodes are part of a collaborative effort between different organizations, including academic institutions, government agencies, and non-profit organizations. The data collected by the nodes is made available to researchers and the public for analysis and use in developing solutions for climate change mitigation and adaptation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How was the data collected?\n",
    "BEACO2N blankets interesting locations with a network of sensors - called **\"nodes\"** -  approximately 1 mile (2km) apart from each other to measure green house gases and air quality. Although their individual nodes are less precise than the highly sensitive traditional sensors, when working as part of a network, our nodes create a highly detailed map of CO2 and pollutants in our air. Their nodes are sampling the air for 6 gases and also aerosol in the same locations, every minute of the day.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CO2**, or carbon dioxide, is typically measured in parts per million (ppm) or parts per billion (ppb). This is because CO2 is a trace gas in the Earth's atmosphere, meaning it makes up only a small fraction of the gases in the air. To measure the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, scientists use instruments like infrared gas analyzers that can detect and quantify the amount of CO2 in a sample of air. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is represented in the data?\n",
    "The locations BEACO2N tracks have nodes that contain sensors for **CO2, NO, NO2, O3, CO, and aerosol** in addition to sensors for **temperature, pressure, and relative humidity**. Data from these sensors are collected once every five seconds onto a miniature computer which then sends the data to a centralized server. When combined with data from other nodes, it can be used to produce concentration maps, track pollution plumes, and to constrain calculations of emissions, to name a few possibilities."

    "Data faithfulness refers to the degree to which data accurately represents the underlying phenomenon it purports to describe. The following terms are important to consider when discussing data faithfulness:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure**: This refers to the organization of the data, including the format, schema, and relationships between different elements. Structured data is typically easier to analyze and interpret than unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Granularity**: This refers to the level of detail in the data. Higher granularity means more detailed data, which may be useful in certain contexts but may also increase the risk of identifying individuals or sensitive information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scope**: This refers to the range of data being considered. For example, data may be limited to a specific geographic area or time period, which can impact its representativeness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Temporality**: This refers to the time dimension of the data, including when it was collected, how frequently it is updated, and whether it captures changes over time. Temporal consistency is important for longitudinal analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Faithfulness**: This refers to the accuracy and reliability of the data, including how it was collected, whether there were biases in the sampling or measurement processes, and whether the data accurately reflects the phenomenon being studied. High data faithfulness means that the data accurately represents the underlying reality, while low data faithfulness may lead to incorrect or biased conclusions."
