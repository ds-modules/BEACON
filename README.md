**Goal:** The curriculum consists of five lessons in Jupyter notebooks hosted in Google Colab and is designed for students who have little to no prior coding experience. The lessons introduce Python, the pandas package, and data visualization, and apply these skills to work with real-world greenhouse gas and air pollutant data from the Berkeley Environmental Air Quality and CO 2 Network (BEACO 2 N). The curriculum emphasizes both transferrable programming skills and content knowledge. The work demonstrates how integrating real-world datasets into high school science courses can broaden participation in programming, foster environmental literacy, and equip students with data science skills that prepare them to engage in data-driven inquiry across disciplines.
